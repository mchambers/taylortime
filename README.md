What better way to check out the hot new Swift programming language then with tweets from our very own Taylor Swift!

What's in the box?
------------------

Your very own iOS 8 app that uses NSURLSession to hit up Twitter, fetch an application-level bearer token, then retrieve the latest tweets of one taylorswift13.

What can I see in action?
-------------------------

* Some asynchronous network calls via NSURLSession
* Bridging between NSArray/NSDictionary and Swift arrays/dictionaries
* Random number generation
* Some struct initialization
* Closures (and trailing closure syntax!)
* The raw emotion of a lost soul, happy and free, yet so confused

Is this good Swift code?
------------------------

I'd like to think so. I mean, I did sit through the entire "Introduction to Swift" session at WWDC.

Are you an Apple Developer Evangelist of some sort?
--------------------------------------

Not yet. WINK WINK.

Who are you, then?
